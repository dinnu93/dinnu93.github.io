# Who do I want to become ?

This is a question that's been bothering me for quite some time. Since the start of the pandemic I had a lot of time to think about myself and I have to say, I hate what I've become over the past few years. Needless to say I picked up some bad habits in my twenty's like not exercising, watching too much youtube and movies, not having any savings or investments. And the biggest, still not starting a company, the sole reason for which I dropped out of college. 

All the above bad habits took a huge toll on my physical & mental well being. And this lead me to lose my self-worth, relationships & eventually my goddamn mind for a short while. Thankfully I travelled to the mountains and started hiking again, It gave me some of my self-worth and determination back. It also gave me a financial discipline of living on a shoe-string budget. After that I really wanted to learn how to grow my own food, live in a peaceful community, Auroville, an international community near Pondicherry gave me all those things, I spent an year and half in Auroville volunteering at an organic farm and started volunteering my programming skills to a non-profit in Auroville, Thus finding my love for programming again.

Although I triumphed in some things, I still have a long way to go, the pandemic really brought a lot of things I was struggling with internally for all these years to the surface, Due to sheltering-in-place, a broken toe & bed rest I gained a lot of weight, As I didn't work for the last two years I didn't have any real savings hence I'm living with my parents. So now that you have all the background information. Let me answer the main question and the title of this article.

* I want to become a heathy person.
* I want to meditate everyday.
* I want to launch a series of websites, starting with this blog.
* I want to make webapps which solve a problem for my  paying customers.
* I hope the culumination of all the things listed above will make me a happy and healthy person.
